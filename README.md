# PyCaret-Project-for-customer-segmentation

OBJECTIVE: Customers are the lifeblood of any firm. Customer retention should be implemented with the firm's long-term goals in any organization that serves a large number of customers. In general, businesses spend a lot of money to attract new consumers, but often don't know that their existing clients account for the majority of their sales and earnings. 
 
Customer analytics, which serves as the foundation for all marketing efforts, includes approaches such as predictive modeling, data visualization, information management, and segmentation. Customer segmentation and a product recommendation engine are employed effectively to maximize sales and conversions. We shall concentrate on customer segmentation in this project. Marketers can use segmentation to better customize their marketing efforts to different audience segments.
 

Customer segmentation is the process of breaking customers into multiple groups based on shared criteria in order for businesses to promote each group efficiently and appropriately.
